# CoinCurrencyAssignment2

## What Works
• Reads file and inputs data into arrays of structs
• Computes change for every amount
• If data contains invalid amount, a message is displayed saying which specific line
contains the incorrect value
• Menu is shown
• If 1 is selected then user is prompt for name and enters name where the change for the
given name is shown
• Continuously prompts user for name until 2 is selected
• If 2 is selected then program exits
• If name cannot be found then appropriate message is displayed
• Data from input file is printed in output file along with change values

## What Doesn’t Work
• Could not create a function that adds the amounts of the same currencies under the same
individual name
• Even repeated names in input file are repeated in output file
• Program accepts any number of lines of data instead of only 0-10
